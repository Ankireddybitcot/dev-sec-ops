# AWS Security - Recover or Rotate SSH Keys using SSM

  We will use [AWS SSM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JnOVMb4lTs) to recover a server for which there is no ssh key is attached or A server for which the SSH key is lost <sup>[Ref](#References)</sup>. We can use the similar technique to rotate the ssh keys for security reasons.

## Lab Setup

  You have couple of options to set this up in your account, You can use [AWS CDK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwxpszw0Rc) or use the cloudformation template generated by CDK.

### Method 1: Using AWS CDK

  If you have AWS CDK installed you can close this repository and deploy the stack with 

      ```sh
      git clone git@github.com:miztiik/dev-sec-ops.git
      cd ./dev-sec-ops/rotate-recover-ec2-ssh-keys/
      source .env/bin/activate
      cdk deploy
      ```

### Method 2: Using AWS CDK

  If you are using cloudformation, the templates are under `cdk.out` directory the naming is usually `DIR_NAME.template.json`.
